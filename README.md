# csharp-first-project
All of this started as a project for C# Academy classes by .NET PG community.
My plan is to make a chat service. With independent multithreaded server, that can operate multi chat rooms, and desktop, web and mobile app for clients.
First version will be probably simplest chat and server just for C# Academy project. After that I plan to continue evolving this project to make 
a finished product of chat service + client applications for Desktop, web and mobile.
